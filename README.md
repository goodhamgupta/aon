# AON-tensorflow

Tensorflow implementation of [AON: Towards Arbitrarily-Oriented Text Recognition](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Cheng_AON_Towards_Arbitrarily-Oriented_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) that extracts feature sequences in four directions and combines them into an attention-based decoder to generate character sequence.
